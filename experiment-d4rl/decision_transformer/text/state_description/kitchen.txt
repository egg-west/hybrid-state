The environment is based on the 9 degrees of freedom Franka robot. The Franka robot is placed in a kitchen environment containing several common household items: a microwave, a kettle, an overhead light, cabinets, and an oven. The environment is a multitask goal in which the robot has to interact with the previously mentioned items in order to reach a desired goal configuration. For example, one such state is to have the microwave and sliding cabinet door open with the kettle on the top burner and the overhead light on. The goal tasks can be configured when the environment is created. The dataset consists of the robot performing all of the desired tasks in order.
